My wife bought some Schmidt Brothers knives from Costco to supplement/replace our three Wustof knives from the last 20 years.*  But she didn't want them taking up space on the counter, so just wanted them in a drawer.  That's great, except it turns into a disorganized mess.  So, she asked me to design a solution, and this is it.





* On a related note we had been using a magnetic knife strip for those and I designed a different improvement for that.
