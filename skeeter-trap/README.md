Working on a home built mosquito trap.  Primarily for indoors when they're trying to attack you while you sleep.

# Overview

I want to build something to capture indoor mosquitos.  Goal is to use a 120mm case fan with LEDs.  It is possible that CO2 could get worked in, but later.

There are commercial products that do this, but honestly, they're ugly and noisy than I'd like.  So, I'd like to build something that is quiet, effective and more customizable.

# Progress

I need to upload current progress, but I have so far:

* Built one with a laser cut wooden box
* Done some 3D design and printing for a second one
* Bought a few case fans
* Have done some various test runs
