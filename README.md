# Hobbies

This is the repo for documenting the various things I have created because I find them interesting.  Most of them tend to be "Design & Fabricate" but there is some variety.  Some have required code and some of them are only code.  

I make no commitments to the elegance of the code or the quality of the comments.  Mostly, these were all for me to have a little fun.

* [Lock and Key](lock-n-key):  A novel system of creating a "key" out of resin that can be used to create secure locks.  Patent pending, not because it is likely to get manufactured, but because the company I work for believes it has some interesting intellectual property aspects.
* [Intubation box](Intubation-Box): How to build an intubation box as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for doctors
