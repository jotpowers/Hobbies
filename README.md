# Hobbies

This is the repo for various code (and I guess maybe documentation) I write for hobbies.  At least initially, probably mostly Arduino code, since I've had a few projects that use that.  

I make no commitments to the elegance of the code or the quality of the comments.  Mostly, these were all for me to have a little fun.

* [Lock and Key](lock-n-key):  Resulted in a patent application
* [Intubation box](Intubation-Box): How to build an intubation box as PPE for doctors
