I got this recipe from somewhere. Used it to make delicious pasties.  Subsequently I have tried to find this recipe and failed, so documenting it here.

## Components
### Pasty Dough

It's just a [Shortcrust Pastry](https://www.daringgourmet.com/authentic-cornish-pasty-recipe/)

### Chicken

* [Instant Pot shredded chicken](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/instant-pot-shredded-chicken/)

> *Note*: I actually like to brine the chicken for at least an hour, and then leave out the salt from this recipe.

### BBQ sauce

* 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
* 1 cup pineapple tidbits, drained
* 1 cup thinly sliced red onion
* 2 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced.  1 seeded and deveined.
* 4 cup shredded marble cheddar cheese

## Directions

* Mix chicken with BBQ sauce
* Make pasties according to standard pasty recipes with the BBQ chicken in it.
* Bake and serve
