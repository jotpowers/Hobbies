I got this recipe from somewhere. Used it to make delicious pasties.  Subsequently I have tried to refind this recipe and failed, so documenting it here.

* 2 cup shredded cooked chicken
* 1/2 cup barbecue sauce
* 1 cup pineapple tidbits, drained
* 1 cup thinly sliced red onion
* 2 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced.  1 seeded and deveined.
* 4 cup shredded marble cheddar cheese
