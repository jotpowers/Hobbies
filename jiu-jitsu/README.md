I'm finally getting around to start documenting some of my "learnings" from jiu-jitsu.  Let's be clear, I'm not very good.  I'm an older, lightweight(ish), lower belt, so if you disagree with something I put here, you're probably right.  

That being said, I tend to be pretty analytical, and people say my game is "technical" (which I think is their nice way of saying "wow, you're not very athletic").  So, I figured I'd start documenting the things that I think are really helpful for people starting out, because it's so easy to forget how hard it was.


:::note 
When I say something is "always" true, you should recognize that [60% of the time it's true 100% of the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKiSPUc2Jck&t=80s).  Which is to say, it's mostly true and true enough when you're starting out that you can take it as an absolute.  When you begin to learn better, you'll know enough that you're no longer reading this and you can laugh at the naivete.

# Starting Out

When you start out it is overwhelming.  You feel like you're fighting for your life and you learn about some technique, and when you go to implement it, you can't remember any of the pieces and the pieces you can remember don't even work.  Small children are climbing all over you like you're some sort of incompetent jungle-gym and you're flopping around like a like a wounded mackrel.  Don't worry, that's normal.

It was six months before I was doing a move and I felt what my opponent was doing and knew what a counter was and could implement it.
