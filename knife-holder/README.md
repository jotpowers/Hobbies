# Introduction

One of the things that you learn through your journey of building things is what makes sense to laser cut and what makes sense to 3D print.  Importantly, what your final process is going to be heavily impacts your design decisions.  I'll probably talk more about this when I get the [Name Badge] documentation done.  One thing that impacts that is realizing that you can "weld" acrylic.  Much like PVC, the "glues" for acrylic are actually solvents that dissolve the material and allow it to solidify.  This means that if you get the dimensions correct that you can turn 2D laser cut items into solid 3D solutions.
