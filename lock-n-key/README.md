This project came out of some brainstorming at work.  The idea was to build a physically randomized key that could be easily made, and then read, using light.  I spent part of a couple of weekends working on it, and it was really entertaining, with a number of really interesting learnings.  In the end, this was submitted for a patent, so I had to hold off publishing any of it until it was with the patent office.  

# Basics

*  Resin "keys"
*  3D printed "lock"
*  Arduino with LED or laser being read by photoresistors
  *  Code to do the various pulsing and reading
